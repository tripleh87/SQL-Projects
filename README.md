Hello guys!, 

In this SQL project section, I am trying to somehow showcase that I can code SQL a bit :)

1. Databases: I am taking random databases or working on ones created by myself.
2. I will be applying different SQL queries on the databses, and taking screenshots as a "prove" of the code.
3. As for what queries to write: I took some exercises from different sites and applied them.
4. RBMS: I am trying to apply the code on: MySQL, DB Browser and Oracle.
